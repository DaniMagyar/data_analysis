During Pavlovian fear conditioning, presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) ecites neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA). Prevailing models posit that stimulus evoked spiking in the LA is relayed to its principal downstream nuclei - the basal nucleus (BA) and central amygdala (CeA). To test this, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, head fixed mice. Contrary to this prediction, CS and US presentation did not increase firing significantly in the BA or CeA. By contrast, neurons in the amygdalostriatal transition area (AStria) exhibited LA like responses. During CS–US pairing, responses in the LA and AStr resembled US evoked activity with no additional increase beyond the US alone. Finally, short latency spiking in the LA and AStr was regulated by parvalbumin (PV)–expressing interneurons. These findings support the view that the LA and AStria operate as a functional unit integrating CS and US signals during conditioned fear learning.

During Pavlovian fear conditioning, presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) excites neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA). Prevailing models posit that stimulus evoked spiking in the LA is relayed to its principal downstream nuclei - the basal nucleus (BA) and central amygdala (CeA). To test this, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, head fixed mice. Contrary to this prediction, CS presentation did not increase firing in the BA or CeA, and the US produced only modest elevations. By contrast, neurons in the amygdalostriatal transition area (AStria) exhibited LA like responses at both short latency (≥40 ms after stimulus onset) and over longer timescales (≥500 ms). During CS–US pairing, responses in the LA and AStria resembled US evoked activity with no additional increase beyond the US alone. In fact, CS responsive neurons were inhibited if CS was co-presented with the US. Finally, using optogenetics we observed that short latency spiking in the LA and AStria was regulated by parvalbumin–expressing interneurons. These findings support the view that the LA and AStr operate as a functional unit integrating CS and US signals during conditioned fear learning, whereas BA and CeA neurons are not recruited by these stimuli under our conditions.

Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely used model for studying the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US), processes strongly linked to amygdala function. Yet the stimulus evoked spiking dynamics across amygdala subregions remain incompletely characterized in vivo. Here we recorded stimulus driven firing in four amygdala regions: the lateral nucleus (LA), basal nucleus (BA), amygdalostriatal transition area (AStr), and central amygdala (CeA) in awake, head fixed mice. In the LA and AStr, we identified three groups of activated neurons that were excited only by the CS, only by the US, or by both; responses occurred at short (≥40 ms) latency and within a long (≥500 ms) timeframe. In contrast, CS alone did not increase spiking in the BA or CeA, despite their downstream position relative to LA. During CS–US pairing, LA and AStr responses resembled US evoked activity solely, with no additional increase beyond the US response. Finally, short latency spiking in LA and AStr was regulated by parvalbumin (PV)–expressing interneurons. These findings indicate that CS evoked activity in LA and AStr reflects both monosynaptic and polysynaptic excitation and support the view that LA and AStr operate as a functional unit integrating CS and US signals during conditioned fear learning.
