========================================
LIGHT INHIBITION DETECTION CRITERIA
========================================

Detection method:
  - Baseline window: -5.0s to -0.5s before stimulus onset
  - Recent window: -0.5s to 0s before stimulus onset (light illumination period)
  - Statistical test: Wilcoxon ranksum (right-tailed, testing baseline > recent)
  - Significance threshold: p < 0.05
  - Firing rate drop threshold: 50%
  - Inclusion criteria: Neuron marked as light-inhibited if it meets BOTH criteria
    (p-value AND FR drop) in ANY light condition (CS or US)

========================================
CLUSTER CLASSIFICATION OF LIGHT-INHIBITED NEURONS
========================================

Light-inhibited neurons are further classified based on their responses
to CS and US stimuli during NO-LIGHT conditions:
  - CS-selective: CS excited (z >= 2.0), US not excited
  - US-selective: US excited (z >= 2.0), CS not excited
  - Multisensory: Both CS and US excited (z >= 2.0)
  - Inhibited: FR drop >= 50% in CS or US (not excited by either)
  - Non-responsive: No significant excitation or inhibition
