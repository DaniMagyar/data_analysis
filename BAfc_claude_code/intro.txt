The formation of long term fear memories is essential for survival and is mediated, at least in part, by amygdala circuitry. Prior work has identified the lateral amygdala (LA) as a critical site where, during Pavlovian fear conditioning, the neutral conditioned stimulus (CS; e.g., a tone) and the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g., a footshock) converge to form the memory engram. Acquisition is thought to rely on synaptic potentiation at thalamic afferents onto a sparse subset (~10–30%) of LA neurons.
Electrophysiology indicates that auditory CS information reaches the LA via two parallel routes. Thalamic nuclei, including the medial geniculate body and posterior intralaminar nucleus (MGm/PIL), drive rapid responses with latencies of ~15–20 ms, whereas auditory cortex–driven responses arrive later. Thus, tone-evoked responses with latencies <20 ms are triggered by thalamic input, whereas later spiking upon tone presentation likely reflects a combination of local recurrent activity in LA circuits and cortical drive. Although the source of US input to the LA was once uncertain, recent studies show that the MGm/PIL pathway conveys footshock evoked firing in the LA, and some LA-projecting thalamic neurons in these nuclei are activated by both stimuli. These findings raise the question of how CS- and US-driven excitation shapes LA activity and whether they interact when presented together.
In the prevailing model, CS–US evoked activity in the LA instructs downstream regions, including the basal amygdala (BA) and central amygdala (CeA), to generate appropriate defensive behavior based on learned fear. However, an in vitro study suggests that the LA may transmit information primarily to the neighboring amygdalo striatal transition area (AStria), rather than to the BA or CeA. Notably, the AStria shares thalamic and auditory cortical inputs with the LA (LeDoux et al., 1992; Romanski & LeDoux, 1993), suggesting that this striatal area dorsal to the CeA may also participate in CS and US processing. Yet how AStria neurons respond to these stimuli remains unclear.
To address these questions, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings within the LA and AStria in awake, head fixed mice and compared stimulus evoked spiking with that in the BA and CeA. Contrary to prevailing predictions, CS presentation did not significantly increase firing in the BA or CeA, and US evoked activity was only modest in these canonical output nuclei. Instead, AStria neurons exhibited LA like responses on both short (≥40 ms) and long (≥500 ms) timescales. These results challenge the conventional sequential model and suggest that the LA and AStria operate as a functional unit during conditioned fear learning. Our findings may promote re evaluating the information flow immediately downstream of the LA and indicate that the AStria and not the BA and CeA may be primarily recruited during the initial presentation of CS and US stimuli.
