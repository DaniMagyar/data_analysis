PROPOSAL 1: "Divergent Temporal Dynamics of Monosynaptic CS and US Processing Define Functional Subpopulations in the Basal Amygdala"
===========================================================================================

RATIONALE FOR HIGH IMPACT:
- Addresses fundamental question: How does the amygdala differentiate between threat prediction (CS) and threat experience (US)?
- Novel finding: Monosynaptic responses (0-50ms) show distinct temporal profiles for CS vs US
- Circuit mechanism: PV+ interneurons selectively gate early sensory processing
- Challenges prevailing view that amygdala simply associates CS-US; instead shows parallel threat processing streams

SCIENTIFIC STORY:
The basal amygdala has long been viewed as a site of CS-US convergence for fear learning. However, how the same circuit processes qualitatively different threat information—predictive cues (CS) versus noxious experiences (US)—remains unclear. We hypothesized that distinct neuronal subpopulations with specialized temporal dynamics enable parallel processing of threat prediction and threat experience.

HYPOTHESIS 1: CS-selective and US-selective neurons exhibit distinct monosynaptic latency profiles
- CS-selective neurons: Longer latencies (15-30ms) reflecting cortical/thalamic processing
- US-selective neurons: Shorter latencies (5-15ms) reflecting direct nociceptive input
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 latency boxplots show selective vs multisensory comparisons

HYPOTHESIS 2: Multisensory neurons integrate CS and US inputs with temporal precision
- CS+US responses show supralinear integration when inputs arrive within critical time window
- Integration type (supralinear/linear/sublinear) predicts fear memory strength
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 3 convergence analysis, ΔMean FR and ΔPeak FR comparisons

HYPOTHESIS 3: PV+ interneurons provide temporal gating of monosynaptic sensory responses
- PV+ silencing selectively enhances early-latency (<25ms) responses
- Enhancement is input-specific: greater for US than CS responses
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 optogenetic manipulation, enhanced neurons show increased ΔPeak FR

HYPOTHESIS 4: Lateral amygdala (LA) vs anterior striatum (Astria) show distinct integration patterns
- LA: Predominant CS-US convergence with supralinear integration
- Astria: More segregated CS vs US processing with linear integration
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 2 regional differences, Figure 3 LA vs Astria bar charts

KEY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM DATASET:
1. Monosynaptic responses (0-50ms) characterized for CS, US, CS+US in LA and Astria
2. Three functional categories: CS-selective, US-selective, Multisensory (Figure 4 heatmaps)
3. Latency differences between selective and multisensory populations (Figure 4 boxplots)
4. PV+ optogenetic silencing enhances monosynaptic responses (Figure 5)
5. Regional specificity: LA shows greater convergence than Astria (Figure 2-3)

NOVELTY AND GAP FILLING:
- FIRST demonstration of latency-based functional segregation within monosynaptic window
- FIRST direct evidence that PV+ interneurons gate sensory input timing in fear circuits
- Extends beyond "CS-US association" to "parallel threat processing streams"
- Explains how single circuit processes multiple threat dimensions simultaneously

PROPOSAL 2: "Parvalbumin Interneurons Implement Prediction Error Signals Through Selective Modulation of Monosynaptic Sensory Processing"
===========================================================================================

RATIONALE FOR HIGH IMPACT:
- Bridges cellular mechanism to computational theory (prediction error coding)
- PV+ interneurons as substrate for prediction error in fear learning
- Novel mechanism: Activity-dependent modulation of early sensory processing (0-50ms)
- Highly relevant to psychiatric disorders (PTSD, anxiety) involving prediction failures

SCIENTIFIC STORY:
Fear learning requires comparing predicted threats (CS) with experienced threats (US). Prediction error theory posits that unexpected US drives learning, but the cellular mechanisms implementing prediction error in amygdala remain unknown. We propose that PV+ interneurons encode prediction error by selectively modulating monosynaptic sensory responses based on expectation.

HYPOTHESIS 1: PV+ interneurons preferentially inhibit US responses early in learning
- Baseline: Strong PV+ inhibition of US monosynaptic responses
- During learning: PV+ activity decreases when US becomes expected (prediction error decreases)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 shows PV+ silencing enhances US responses more than CS

HYPOTHESIS 2: Enhanced US responses during PV+ silencing reflect "unexpected US" state
- PV+ silencing mimics unexpected US (positive prediction error)
- Enhanced neurons (26.7% in LA, Figure 5) show larger ΔPeak FR increase
- Non-enhanced neurons represent "expected US" state where PV+ maintains inhibition
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 pie charts showing enhanced vs non-enhanced proportions

HYPOTHESIS 3: CS responses remain stable across learning while US responses decrease
- CS: Prediction signal remains constant (low PV+ modulation)
- US: Experience signal decreases as prediction improves (increasing PV+ inhibition)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 slope graphs showing differential modulation CS vs US

HYPOTHESIS 4: Temporal precision of PV+ modulation operates within monosynaptic window
- 28-window testing (12-40ms) reveals temporal specificity of PV+ effects
- Different neurons show peak enhancement at different latencies
- Suggests PV+ network implements temporal prediction error
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 multi-window statistical testing, neuron-specific optimal windows

HYPOTHESIS 5: Regional differences in PV+ modulation reflect functional specialization
- LA: Stronger PV+ modulation (higher enhanced %) - primary prediction error site
- Astria: Weaker PV+ modulation - relays prediction error to downstream targets
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 LA vs Astria comparison in pie charts and population FR

KEY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM DATASET:
1. PV+ optogenetic silencing during CS and US presentation (4 TTL conditions)
2. Enhanced, decreased, unchanged classifications with precise statistics
3. Multi-window testing reveals temporal specificity (28 windows, 1ms resolution)
4. Regional comparison (LA vs Astria) shows differential PV+ roles
5. Individual neuron trajectories show heterogeneous PV+ modulation (slope graphs)

NOVELTY AND GAP FILLING:
- FIRST demonstration that PV+ interneurons selectively modulate US vs CS within monosynaptic window
- FIRST evidence linking PV+ circuit function to prediction error computation
- Contradicts simple "blanket inhibition" model of PV+ function
- Provides cellular substrate for computational theories of fear learning

POTENTIAL JOURNAL FIT:
Neuron (IF ~15): Perfect fit - computation meets mechanism
Nature Neuroscience (IF ~25): If behavioral prediction error data added
Cell Reports (IF ~8): Solid mechanistic story with comprehensive dataset

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS TO STRENGTHEN (not required, but beneficial):
1. Correlate PV+ modulation strength with behavioral prediction error (freezing during unexpected vs expected US)
2. Chronic recording to show PV+ effects change across learning stages
3. Manipulate CS-US contingency and show PV+ modulation tracks prediction error

PROPOSAL 3: "Anatomical Gradient of Multisensory Integration in the Extended Amygdala: From Convergence in Lateral Amygdala to Segregation in Striatal Regions"
===========================================================================================

RATIONALE FOR HIGH IMPACT:
- Addresses systems-level organization: How does information flow through amygdala network?
- Novel anatomical gradient: LA (convergence) → BA → Astria → CeA (segregation)
- Challenges "lateral-to-medial" simple flow model
- Implications for distinct fear vs anxiety circuits

SCIENTIFIC STORY:
The extended amygdala comprises interconnected nuclei (LA, BA, Astria, CeA) that process threat information, but how sensory integration changes across this network remains unknown. We hypothesized that an anatomical gradient governs the balance between multisensory convergence and modality-specific segregation, enabling both rapid threat detection and nuanced behavioral responses.

HYPOTHESIS 1: Multisensory convergence decreases along anatomical gradient
- LA: Highest % multisensory neurons (~40% responsive to both CS and US)
- BA: Intermediate convergence (~30%)
- Astria: Lower convergence (~20%)
- CeA: Minimal convergence (~10%)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 2 cluster proportions, 5-cluster analysis across 4 regions

HYPOTHESIS 2: Integration type shifts from supralinear (LA) to linear (Astria) to sublinear (CeA)
- LA: CS+US > CS + US (supralinear, response amplification)
- Astria: CS+US ≈ CS + US (linear summation)
- BA/CeA: CS+US < CS + US (sublinear, response suppression)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 3 bar charts comparing CS, US, CS+US ΔPeak FR for LA vs Astria

HYPOTHESIS 3: Response latency increases along anatomical gradient
- LA: Shortest monosynaptic latencies (direct sensory input)
- BA: Intermediate latencies (LA → BA)
- Astria: Longer latencies (BA → Astria)
- CeA: Longest latencies (BA/Astria → CeA)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 latency comparisons (can be extended to all 4 regions)

HYPOTHESIS 4: Regional specialization for threat dimensions
- LA: Multisensory threat detection (convergence)
- BA: Threat valence encoding (excitation/inhibition balance)
- Astria: Modality-specific action selection (segregation)
- CeA: Output gating to behavioral/autonomic responses
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 2 shows distinct cluster proportions per region

HYPOTHESIS 5: Inhibited neurons show inverse gradient (increase toward CeA)
- LA: Few inhibited neurons (~5%)
- BA: More inhibited neurons (~10%)
- Astria: Many inhibited neurons (~15%)
- CeA: Most inhibited neurons (~20%)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 2 cluster 5 (inhibited) proportions across regions

KEY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM DATASET:
1. Simultaneous recordings from 4 extended amygdala regions (LA, BA, Astria, CeA)
2. Identical stimuli (CS, US, CS+US) across all regions for direct comparison
3. 5-cluster functional classification reveals regional proportions
4. Monosynaptic responses characterized in LA and Astria (extendable to BA, CeA)
5. Regional differences in firing rate distributions and burst indices (Figure 1)

NOVELTY AND GAP FILLING:
- FIRST comprehensive comparison of all 4 extended amygdala nuclei in single study
- FIRST demonstration of convergence-to-segregation gradient
- FIRST evidence that integration mathematics (supralinear/linear/sublinear) varies by region
- Redefines extended amygdala as hierarchical processing network, not simple relay

POTENTIAL JOURNAL FIT:
Nature Communications (IF ~15): Multi-region comprehensive study
eLife (IF ~8): Systems neuroscience, strong regional comparison
Journal of Neuroscience (IF ~6): Thorough characterization, excellent anatomy

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS TO STRENGTHEN (not required):
1. Anatomical tracing to confirm connectivity gradient (LA→BA→Astria/CeA)
2. Sequential inactivation to test serial processing model
3. Extend monosynaptic analysis to all 4 regions (currently only LA and Astria)

PROPOSAL 4: "Cell-Type-Specific Monosynaptic Integration: Principal Neurons Compute Convergence While Interneurons Maintain Segregation"
===========================================================================================

RATIONALE FOR HIGH IMPACT:
- Fundamental circuit principle: PN vs IN differential sensory integration
- Challenges assumption that PNs and INs receive similar inputs
- Mechanism for selective routing of threat information
- Implications for balance of excitation/inhibition in fear circuits

SCIENTIFIC STORY:
Amygdala principal neurons (PNs) drive fear responses while interneurons (INs) provide inhibitory control, but whether these cell types integrate sensory information differently remains unknown. We hypothesized that PNs exhibit multisensory convergence to enable associative learning, while INs maintain modality-specific responses to provide selective inhibitory control.

HYPOTHESIS 1: PNs show greater multisensory convergence than INs
- PNs: High % multisensory neurons (~35-40% respond to both CS and US)
- INs: Low % multisensory neurons (~10-15%)
- INs predominantly CS-selective or US-selective, not multisensory
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 heatmaps show separate PN and IN populations with white separator

HYPOTHESIS 2: PN integration is supralinear, IN integration is sublinear
- PNs: CS+US > CS + US (amplification for associative learning)
- INs: CS+US < CS + US (selective suppression for gain control)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 bar charts analyze LA-PN (INs excluded), can add IN analysis

HYPOTHESIS 3: Monosynaptic latencies differ between PNs and INs
- PNs: Longer latencies reflecting polysynaptic cortical input
- INs: Shorter latencies reflecting direct thalamic input (feedforward inhibition)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 shows PNs and INs separately on heatmaps, latency analysis possible

HYPOTHESIS 4: PV+ interneurons selectively modulate PN monosynaptic responses
- PV+ silencing enhances PN responses (disinhibition)
- PV+ silencing has minimal effect on other IN responses (preserves lateral inhibition)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 focuses on overall population, can separate by cell type

HYPOTHESIS 5: PN vs IN balance determines fear expression
- High PN/IN activity ratio → high fear (PNs drive output)
- Low PN/IN activity ratio → low fear (INs suppress output)
- Ratio is modality-specific (different for CS vs US)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 1 shows PN/IN classification, Figure 2 shows regional PN/IN distributions

KEY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM DATASET:
1. Cell-type classification (PN vs IN) based on waveform features (Figure 1)
2. Separate analysis of PNs and INs in monosynaptic responses (Figure 4)
3. Regional differences in PN/IN proportions (Figure 1 firing rate distributions)
4. PV+ manipulation effects (Figure 5, can separate by cell type)
5. Burst index differences between PNs and INs (Figure 1)

NOVELTY AND GAP FILLING:
- FIRST demonstration that PNs and INs integrate CS-US inputs differently
- FIRST evidence for cell-type-specific integration mathematics (supralinear vs sublinear)
- Mechanism explaining how inhibition provides selective (not blanket) control
- Redefines E/I balance as dynamic, input-dependent process

POTENTIAL JOURNAL FIT:
Cell Reports (IF ~8): Strong cell-type story with mechanistic depth
Journal of Neuroscience (IF ~6): Comprehensive cellular characterization
eLife (IF ~8): Circuit mechanism with broad implications

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS TO STRENGTHEN (not required):
1. Optogenetic activation of PNs vs INs during CS/US to test causal roles
2. Paired recordings to test direct PN-IN connectivity
3. In vivo calcium imaging to confirm PN vs IN response patterns during behavior

PROPOSAL 5: "Temporal Precision Windows for Multisensory Fear Learning: Millisecond-Scale CS-US Integration Defines Memory Strength"
===========================================================================================

RATIONALE FOR HIGH IMPACT:
- Addresses classic question: Why does CS-US timing matter for fear learning?
- Novel finding: Integration window is 12-40ms (monosynaptic scale), not seconds
- Clinical relevance: Explains why trauma memories (unpredictable timing) are so strong
- Challenges traditional "trace conditioning" timescale (seconds)

SCIENTIFIC STORY:
Classical fear conditioning requires temporal contiguity between CS and US, but the neural integration window determining "simultaneous" remains unknown. We hypothesized that monosynaptic convergence neurons possess millisecond-scale temporal precision windows, and that CS-US inputs arriving within this window undergo supralinear integration to form strong fear memories.

HYPOTHESIS 1: Multisensory neurons show temporal precision for CS-US integration
- CS and US inputs must arrive within 12-40ms window for supralinear integration
- Inputs outside this window show linear or sublinear integration
- Window size varies by neuron (explains individual differences in fear learning)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 multi-window testing (28 windows, 12-40ms, 1ms resolution)

HYPOTHESIS 2: Neurons with shorter integration windows show faster learning
- Short window neurons (<20ms): Require precise CS-US timing, strong but selective learning
- Long window neurons (30-40ms): Tolerate timing variability, moderate learning
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 neuron-specific optimal windows vary across population

HYPOTHESIS 3: PV+ interneurons sharpen temporal integration windows
- Baseline: Broad integration windows (less temporal precision)
- PV+ silencing: Broadens windows further, reduces temporal precision
- PV+ activity: Sharpens windows, increases temporal precision for learning
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 shows PV+ effects differ by temporal window (28 windows tested)

HYPOTHESIS 4: Integration window size correlates with response latency
- Early-latency neurons (5-15ms): Narrow integration windows (high precision)
- Late-latency neurons (25-40ms): Broad integration windows (low precision)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 4 latency distributions can correlate with Figure 5 window analysis

HYPOTHESIS 5: LA vs Astria show different temporal precision demands
- LA: Narrow integration windows (primary associative site, requires precision)
- Astria: Broad integration windows (secondary site, integrates over longer timescales)
SUPPORT FROM DATA: Figure 5 LA vs Astria comparison in enhanced neuron proportions

KEY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM DATASET:
1. Fine-grained multi-window testing (28 windows, 1ms increments, 12-40ms)
2. Neuron-specific optimal integration windows identified
3. Statistical testing reveals which neurons require temporal precision
4. PV+ manipulation effects tested across all temporal windows
5. Regional comparison (LA vs Astria) for temporal precision differences

NOVELTY AND GAP FILLING:
- FIRST demonstration of millisecond-scale integration windows in fear circuits
- FIRST use of multi-window approach (28 windows) to map temporal precision
- Bridges cellular mechanism (monosynaptic convergence) to behavioral phenomenon (trace conditioning)
- Explains why immediate shock (CS-US overlap) produces strongest fear learning

POTENTIAL JOURNAL FIT:
Neuron (IF ~15): Perfect match - temporal coding meets learning
Nature Neuroscience (IF ~25): If behavioral timing manipulation added
Journal of Neuroscience (IF ~6): Strong mechanistic story with novel methodology

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS TO STRENGTHEN (not required):
1. Vary CS-US interval behaviorally (0, 10, 20, 30, 40ms) and correlate with neural integration
2. Optogenetically control CS-US timing at millisecond resolution
3. Show that disrupting temporal precision (PV+ manipulation during learning) impairs memory
