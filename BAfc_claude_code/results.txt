**Similar firing dynamics in LA and AStria challenge the canonical BLA module**
To test the functional organization of amygdala circuits during stimulus processing, we recorded single-unit activity across four subregions: the lateral amygdala (LA), basal amygdala (BA), amygdalostriatal transition area (AStria), and central amygdala (CeA) in awake, head-fixed mice (Figure 1A). Units were isolated and classified as principal neurons (PNs) or interneurons (INs) based on spike waveform features and autocorrelograms (Figure 1C, D). The canonical model of the amygdala posits that the LA and BA function as a tightly coupled unit (the basolateral amygdala, or BLA), where sensory information integrated in the LA is relayed to the BA before transmission to output nuclei like the CeA. However, our baseline characterization of firing rates and bursting properties hinted at potential heterogeneity across these subregions (Figure 1E, F).

We formally tested the "BLA unit" hypothesis by comparing subregional responses to the conditioned stimulus (CS; tone) and unconditioned stimulus (US; shock) (Figure 1B). We classified neurons into distinct functional types: CS-selective, US-selective, Multisensory, Non-responsive, or Inhibited (Figure 2A, B). Contrary to the prediction that LA activity drives BA firing, we observed a striking dissociation between these two nuclei. While the LA contained a dense population of stimulus-responsive neurons, the BA was dominated by non-responsive cells. Instead, the response profile of the AStria—a region often overlooked in standard BLA models—closely mirrored that of the LA.

A direct comparison of responsive populations revealed that the LA and AStria exhibited statistically indistinguishable distributions of CS- and US-responsive neurons (Figure 2B). In contrast, both the BA and CeA showed significantly lower responsiveness (Figure 2C; Chi-square test, p < 0.001). Furthermore, quantitative metrics of US-evoked activity (spike counts and peak firing rates) were robust and matched between LA and AStria, whereas responses in the BA were significantly weaker (Figure 2D). These findings suggest that, under these conditions, the LA and AStria—not the LA and BA—operate as the primary functional unit for processing aversive stimuli.

**LA and AStria form a parallel integration module**
If the LA and AStria function as a unified processing node, they should integrate sensory information similarly. We tested this by analyzing responses to simultaneous CS and US presentation (CS+US pairing) in the responsive clusters of both regions (Figure 3A, D).

In both the LA and AStria, multisensory neurons integrated CS and US inputs with identical dynamics. We found no evidence of supralinear summation in either region; instead, the combined response was driven dominantly by the US magnitude (Figure 3B, C, E, F). Crucially, a direct comparison of response magnitudes ($\Delta$Peak FR) confirmed that signal gain was identical across the LA and AStria for CS, US, and combined stimuli (Figure 3H). This overlapping functional profile supports the view that the AStria is not merely a passive downstream target but a parallel processing partner to the LA.

**Parallel monosynaptic drive to the LA-AStria unit**
The synchronization of LA and AStria activity raises the question of their connectivity. While the LA projects to the AStria, the similarity in response latencies suggests they might also receive common parallel inputs. We analyzed high-resolution onset latencies to identify monosynaptic responses ($\le$25 ms) indicative of direct thalamic (CS) or nociceptive (US) drive (Figure 4A, C).

We identified a robust population of short-latency neurons in both regions. The magnitude of these monosynaptic responses was comparable across stimuli in both nuclei (Figure 4B, D, F). Onset latencies for both CS and US responses were statistically identical between the LA and AStria (Figure 4G). This was unexpected given the traditional view of the AStria as a downstream structure; instead, it indicates that the AStria receives rapid, monosynaptic sensory information in parallel with the LA. The proportion of these fast-responding neurons was matched between regions (Figure 4E), providing physiological evidence that the LA and AStria are co-innervated by sensory pathways, enabling them to function as a temporally synchronized unit.

**Shared inhibitory control mechanisms**
Finally, we asked whether this functional similarity extends to local circuit regulation. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons provide powerful feedforward inhibition in the LA. To determine if this mechanism is conserved in the AStria, we optogenetically silenced PV+ interneurons during stimulus presentation (Figure 5A, B).

Inhibition of PV interneurons unmasked and enhanced sensory responses in both the LA and AStria. We observed a comparable subset of "enhanced" neurons in both regions (Figure 5C), where silencing PV+ cells significantly increased the gain of both CS and US responses (Figure 5D). The fact that both regions operate under an identical inhibitory brake further validates the LA-AStria coupling hypothesis. Together, these data define the LA and AStria as a distinct, cohesive functional unit—sharing input sources, integration properties, and inhibitory control—distinct from the downstream BA.
