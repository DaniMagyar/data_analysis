**Similar firing dynamics in LA and AStria challenge the canonical BLA module**
To test the functional organization of amygdala circuits during stimulus processing, we recorded single-unit activity from 24 mice across four subregions: the lateral amygdala (LA, n = 293), basal amygdala (BA, n = 219), amygdalostriatal transition area (AStria, n = 120), and central amygdala (CeA, n = 50) in awake, head-fixed mice (Figure 1A). Electrode placement was reconstructed post-mortem via DiI track tracing, confirming targeting of the LA, BA, AStria, and CeA (Figure S1A-E). Units were isolated and classified as putative principal neurons (PNs) or putative fast-spiking interneurons (INs) based on spike waveform features and autocorrelograms (Figure 1C, D); PNs exhibited significantly broader spike waveforms (0.617 ± 0.162 ms; mean ± SD) and lower firing rates (3.77 ± 3.89 Hz) compared to INs (0.298 ± 0.050 ms; 19.11 ± 7.69 Hz; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.001). The canonical model of the amygdala posits that the LA and BA function as a tightly coupled unit (the basolateral amygdala, or BLA), where sensory information integrated in the LA is relayed to the BA before transmission to output nuclei like the CeA. However, our baseline characterization of firing rates and bursting properties hinted at potential heterogeneity across these subregions (Figure 1E, F).

We formally tested the "BLA unit" hypothesis by comparing subregional responses to the conditioned stimulus (CS; tone) and unconditioned stimulus (US; shock) (Figure 1B). We classified neurons into distinct functional types: CS-selective, US-selective, Multisensory, Non-responsive, or Inhibited (Figure 2A, B). In the LA, we observed a diverse distribution of responsiveness: CS-selective (11.60%), US-selective (17.10%), Multisensory (17.40%), Non-responsive (27.60%), and Inhibited (26.30%). This functional classification in the LA was conserved when restricting the analysis to putative principal neurons (Figure S4A-E). This profile was strikingly mirrored in the AStria, which showed a similar composition: CS-selective (10.00%), US-selective (14.20%), Multisensory (21.70%), Non-responsive (31.70%), and Inhibited (22.50%). In contrast, the BA was dominated by Non-responsive (48.40%) and Inhibited (38.40%) neurons, with a smaller US-selective population (13.20%) and a complete absence of CS-selective or Multisensory units (0.00%). Similarly, the CeA was largely quiescent, primarily comprised of Non-responsive (58.00%) and Inhibited (38.00%) cells, with negligible excitatory responses (4.00% Multisensory). These data reveal a dissociation between the LA and BA, while highlighting the AStria as a parallel processing partner to the LA.

A direct comparison of responsive populations revealed that the LA and AStria exhibited statistically indistinguishable distributions of CS- and US-responsive neurons (Chi-square test, p = 0.66, Cramér's V = 0.08; Figure 2B). In contrast, both the BA and CeA showed significantly lower responsiveness (Chi-square test, p < 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.24; Figure 2C; Figure S2A-D). Furthermore, quantitative metrics of US-evoked activity (spike counts and peak firing rates) were robust and matched between LA and AStria ($\Delta$FR: LA 43.80 ± 5.60 Hz, AStria 47.60 ± 10.00 Hz; BA 40.30 ± 5.50 Hz; Kruskal-Wallis test, p > 0.05), whereas responses in the BA were significantly shorter in duration (LA 234.00 ± 20.00 ms, AStria 240.00 ± 29.00 ms vs BA 123.00 ± 18.00 ms; Mann-Whitney U test, LA vs BA p < 0.01, AStria vs BA p < 0.01, LA vs AStria p = 0.86) (Figure 2D). These findings suggest that, under these conditions, the LA and AStria—not the LA and BA—operate as the primary functional unit for processing aversive stimuli.

**LA and AStria form a parallel integration module**
If the LA and AStria function as a unified processing node, they should integrate sensory information similarly. We tested this by analyzing responses to simultaneous CS and US presentation (CS+US pairing) in the responsive clusters of both regions (Figure 3A, D).

We examined how different functional cell types integrated simultaneous inputs. CS-selective neurons exhibited significant response suppression during combined stimulation in both regions (LA: CS 40.20 ± 5.30 Hz vs CS+US 19.00 ± 4.10 Hz; mean ± SEM; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001; AStria: CS 21.20 ± 2.80 Hz vs CS+US 11.90 ± 2.20 Hz, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01). US-selective neurons maintained robust firing, with AStria responses showing no significant change (US 37.40 ± 7.40 Hz vs CS+US 35.90 ± 6.90 Hz, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.29) and LA responses showing only a slight reduction (US 32.60 ± 3.00 Hz vs CS+US 31.00 ± 3.20 Hz, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01). In Multisensory neurons, we found no evidence of supralinear summation; instead, the combined response was driven dominantly by the US magnitude (LA: CS 56.20 ± 7.10 Hz, US 67.50 ± 10.80 Hz, CS+US 78.50 ± 13.00 Hz; AStria: CS 51.90 ± 11.80 Hz, US 58.10 ± 15.80 Hz, CS+US 60.60 ± 14.70 Hz; Figure 3B, C, E, F; Figure S3A-E). Crucially, a direct comparison of response magnitudes ($\Delta$FR) across all responsive neurons confirmed that signal gain was identical across the LA and AStria for CS (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.29), US (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.75), and combined stimuli (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.92) (Figure 3H). These gain dynamics were observed alongside similar proportions of responsive cell types in both regions (Figure 3G). This overlapping functional profile supports the view that the AStria is not merely a passive downstream target but a parallel processing partner to the LA.

**Parallel monosynaptic drive to the LA-AStria unit**
The synchronization of LA and AStria activity raises the question of their connectivity. While the LA projects to the AStria, the similarity in response latencies suggests they might also receive common parallel inputs. We analyzed high-resolution onset latencies to identify monosynaptic responses ($\le$25 ms) indicative of direct thalamic (CS) or nociceptive (US) drive (Figure 4A, C).

We identified a robust population of short-latency neurons in both regions. Mirroring the large time scale dynamics, monosynaptic integration varied by cell type (Figure 4B, D). CS-selective neurons exhibited profound suppression during combined stimulation (LA: CS 145.04 ± 41.99 Hz vs CS+US 15.68 ± 4.47 Hz, p < 0.001; AStria: CS 96.80 ± 17.31 Hz vs CS+US 34.45 ± 10.42 Hz, p = 0.03). US-selective neurons maintained robust firing (LA: US 96.79 ± 13.36 Hz vs CS+US 83.79 ± 11.69 Hz, p < 0.01; AStria: US 144.32 ± 26.73 Hz vs CS+US 123.75 ± 21.50 Hz, p = 0.21). In Multisensory neurons, the combined monosynaptic response was driven by the US magnitude without supralinear summation (LA: CS 152.24 ± 26.25 Hz, US 231.00 ± 32.74 Hz, CS+US 234.45 ± 33.10 Hz; AStria: CS 164.10 ± 31.55 Hz, US 170.87 ± 32.50 Hz, CS+US 161.18 ± 36.23 Hz). The magnitude of these monosynaptic responses was comparable across stimuli in both nuclei (LA CS: 89.50 ± 13.90 Hz, AStria CS: 111.70 ± 18.40 Hz, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.01; LA US: 129.70 ± 15.20 Hz, AStria US: 139.30 ± 19.90 Hz, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.18; LA CS+US: 124.94 ± 15.31 Hz, AStria CS+US: 128.82 ± 20.82 Hz, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.33; Figure 4B, D, F; Figure S5E). Onset latencies for US responses were statistically indistinguishable between regions (LA 17.65 ± 0.30 ms vs AStria 16.73 ± 0.40 ms; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.08). Notably, CS responses were significantly faster in the AStria (14.97 ± 0.52 ms) compared to the LA (16.97 ± 0.39 ms; p < 0.001; Figure 4G), and were consistent across selective and multisensory subpopulations (Figure S5A). This timing—with AStria responding prior to or concurrently with the LA—rules out a serial LA-to-AStria relay and confirms parallel monosynaptic processing. The proportion of these fast-responding neurons was matched between regions (Chi-square, p = 0.13, Cramér's V = 0.16; Figure 4E; Figure S5B-D), providing physiological evidence that the LA and AStria are co-innervated by sensory pathways, enabling them to function as a temporally synchronized unit.

**Shared inhibitory control mechanisms**
Finally, we asked whether this functional similarity extends to local circuit regulation. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons provide powerful feedforward inhibition in the LA. To determine if this mechanism is conserved in the AStria, we targeted PV+ interneurons in a subset of PV-Cre mice (N = 12) by injecting a Cre-dependent inhibitory opsin (AAV5-CAG-FLEX-ArchT-tdTomato) into the amygdala (Figure 5A). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed robust, specific expression of ArchT in PV-positive neurons across both the LA and AStria (Figure 5B). We then optogenetically silenced these interneurons during stimulus presentation. First, we confirmed the efficacy of PV+ interneuron silencing by analyzing their baseline firing rates during the pre-stimulus laser illumination period (-0.5s to 0s). In light-inhibited neurons (LA: n=16, AStria: n=6), laser illumination significantly suppressed baseline firing rates in both regions (LA: 4.59 ± 0.91 Hz no-light vs 1.69 ± 0.38 Hz light, p < 0.001; AStria: 5.69 ± 0.93 Hz no-light vs 2.02 ± 0.33 Hz light, p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure S6A-E). This corresponded to a mean firing rate reduction of 63.20% in LA neurons and 64.50% in AStria neurons.

Inhibition of PV interneurons unmasked and enhanced sensory responses in single neurons from both the LA and AStria (Figure 5C, D). We observed a comparable subset of "enhanced" neurons in both regions (LA: 19.40% [6/31] CS, 12.80% [5/39] US; AStria: 14.30% [5/35] CS, 10.80% [4/37] US; Figure 5E), where silencing PV+ cells significantly increased the gain of both CS and US responses (Figure 5F). The fact that both regions operate under an identical inhibitory brake further validates the LA-AStria coupling hypothesis. Together, these data define the LA and AStria as a distinct, cohesive functional unit—sharing input sources, integration properties, and inhibitory control—distinct from the downstream BA.
